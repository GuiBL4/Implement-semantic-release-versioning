## How can I contribute to this project

Open source software is neither contagious nor a [cancer](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-no-we-dont-hate-open-source-software-and-we-can-prove-it/), as some narrow-minded people have said in the past!

We therefore encourage you to jump on the free software bandwagon and help us, through your contributions and your passion (which we hope will be as contagious as possible), to build this audacious project with our community.

The first question you are probably asking yourself is "how can I be of help to this project"? Here are a few suggestions that come to mind:

- Sharing knowledge and know-how is crucial in such community-driven project. So why not helping us writing the documentation? This will give you a good understanding of the concepts and technology behind Sofair.

- If you're a passionate software engineer, why not contributing through coding? Some challenging tasks in cryptography, graph-based database, blockchain, networking, maths and more can challenge your neurons. Be sure that the core project's team will always take care of onboarding newcommers with care, so that they feel comfortable contributing with us.

- And more...

If none of the above resonates with you, do not hesitate to send us an email at `community@sofair.io`. You are sure to meet an open tribe eager to accept new ideas or contributions. Don't be shy!

The second question that may come to your mind is, "I have an idea of I want to contribute. How can I start?" 

### I have an idea üí°
New ideas should be registered via a Feature Request (FR) in the [Issues](../../issues/) section of this project. Before creating a new FR, please ensure a similar FR doesn't exist already. If it exists already, don't hesitate to share additional thoughts and comments. 

If the FR doesn't exist already, press "New issue" and select "Get started" in the "Feature Request" line. Then all you need to do is to follow our FR form, and share with us your ideas! 

### I've found a bug üêõ
In case you found a bug in our project we kindly ask you to submit a Bug Report (BR) in the [Issues](../../issues/) section of this project. Before creating a new BR, please ensure a similar BR doesn't exist already. If it exists already, don't hesitate to add further comments.

### I want to code üë©‚Äçüíª
In case you want to contribute with your coding skills, please take a look at our contribution workflow:

This diagram describe the generic workflow for developers that would like to contribute to this project. We would like to state that we use a [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), where developers collaborate on code in a single branch (in our case, master).

All coding initiatives should be preceded by an issue (either a bug report or a feature request).  
The Sofair core team can assign an issue to any contributor or a contributor can assign it to himself.  
In order to start coding, the contributor needs to clone or fork the main branch, creating his local copy of the project main branch.  
The contributor works on this local copy, making the necessary code changes. Please make sure to follow the [Sofair coding guidelines](www.google.com)
After making the necessary code changes, the contributor should create a Pull Request(PR) of his local branch and the main branch of the upstream repository (SofairOfficial/project).
